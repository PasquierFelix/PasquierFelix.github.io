<em>We propose new difference-in-difference (DID) estimators for treatments continuously distributed at every time period, as is often the case of trade tariffs, or temperatures. We start by assuming that the data only has two time periods. We also assume that from period one to two, the treatment of some units, the movers, changes, while the treatment of other units, the stayers, does not change. Then, our estimators compare the outcome evolution of movers and stayers with the same value of the treatment at period one. Our estimators only rely on parallel trends assumptions, unlike commonly used two-way fixed effects regressions that also rely on homogeneous treatment effect assumptions. With a continuous treatment, comparisons of movers and stayers with the same period-one treatment can either be achieved by non-parametric regression, or by propensity-score reweighting. We extend our results to applications with more than two time periods, no stayers, and where the treatment may have dynamic effects.</em>
