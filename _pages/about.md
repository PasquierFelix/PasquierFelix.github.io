I am the teaching coordinator of econometrics courses in the department of graduate studies at [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/en/) and a researcher at [CREST](https://crest.science/). I obtained my PhD in Economics from the [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en) in December 2024. My supervisors were [Pr. Xavier d'Haultfoeuille](https://faculty.crest.fr/xdhaultfoeuille/) and [Pr. Arne Uhlendorff](https://sites.google.com/site/arneuhlendorff/).

My research focuses on public policy evaluation. I have a particular interest for differences-in-differences methods, peer effect models and long-term care policies.
